            <p>
              A mask is your first layer of protection againsts Covid-19. In most countries, wearing a masks is mandatory, so it is best to follow such guidelines.
              Masks minimise the amount of water vapour particles from leaving or entering through breathing. Since Covid-19 is spread through tiny water particles, a mask 
              greatly reduces your chances of contracting it through such means.
            </p>

            <p> It is advisable to keep your mask on 100% of the time. Only take it off if you are at home or when dining ONLY when the food has arrived.
              
            </p>

            <p>
              It is really effective at limiting spread when everyone wears one, so play your part!
              Remember to dispose of masks properly, or wash them according to included instructions for the resuable ones.

            <h2>Primary measures: Washing hands</h2>

            <img class ="content-img" alt = "8-step hand wash" src = "https://i.insider.com/5eac5bb13dac9a16824786f3?width=1000&format=jpeg&auto=webp">

            <p>
              Surfaces may have Covid-19 particles on them (along with other viruses or bacteria), so it is important to keep your hands clean,
              especially for the times where you have your mask down. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Hands should be washed after contacting any surfaces outside your household.
              It should be done before dining at a restaurant (if they are open) and when returning home. It is preferable if you can keep them clean as much as possible.
            </p>
            
            <img class ="content-img" alt = "8-step hand wash" src = " https://optimummedical.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Handwashing_web_2-1-373x435.png">

            <p>
              Soap dissolves the fat membrane of Viruses, including Covid-19 particles.
              It takes roughly 20 seconds for the soap to dissolve all viruses, so keep that in mind when washing your hands. 
            </p>

            <p>
              There are tips to making sure every corner of your hands are clean. Make sure to use enough soap to cover your hand and:
              <ol>
                <li> Rub palms together </li>
                <li> Scrub between your fingers</li>
                <li> Rub the backs of your fingers</li>
                <li> Clean the thumbs</li>
                <li> Wash your fingertips + fingernauls</li>
                <li> Rub your wrists</li>
              </ol>
              It is courteous to dry your hands to prevent wetting the floor. With that, your hands are clean (for now)!

            <p>Sometimes, the closest washroom is a little to far away, or you are unable to get there to begin with.
               That is when hand sanitizer is useful. Carrying a small bottle with you everywhere when you are outside would not hurt.
            </p>

            <p>The hand sanitizer should be at least 60% alcohol, and be only used sparringly as a measure.
              Washing with soap is still far more effective after all, especially if your hands are visably dirty (e.g dirt, melted ice cream, oil fron fries).
              A good situation to use them would be like just before having a meal or after handling cash.

            <p> Covid-19 can be contracted through any sort of contact, which include being in close proximity to the infected.
              Socially distance can greaty help with limiting the spread.
            </p>

            <p>Imagine a circle with a radius of about 1m, with you as the center. Being socially distance means staying away ~1m from others. That includes friend groups as well (unfortunately). 
            </p>

            <p> In places with seats, stay one seat apart from others. 
            </p>

            <p> You may be prompted to speak up, but avoiding talking in crowded spaces is recommended.
              Limiting group sizes to 4 people helps as well
