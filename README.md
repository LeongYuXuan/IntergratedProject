# Intergrated Project
## Repository for Intergrated Project for 
Github Page Link: https://leongyuxuan.github.io/IntergratedProject/
## Project Name
### Webpage to inform and educate users about Covid-19 (Covinfo)
A simple page, done as part of IP Project. Topic Choosen: Covid-19

## Design Process
The webpage is ment to be simple considering only 1 member in the pair (Leong Yu Xuan) takes the ID module. The webpage as a result is very simple compared to what the other groups are doing.

Due to Leong Yu Xuan having a PiP assignment that covers a similar topic, some of the code from there (specifically the section that displays Cv-19 Info of Singapore) can be imported from there. Knowledge gathered from there would also be of great help to the coding efforts. Hopefully this website would be literally more functional compared to Assignment 2.

With the nature of the webapp, the page would greatly benefit from a "mobile-first" design, since the main page contains useful infomation that people would like to check on oftenly.

Once again, the workflow would be having the basic functionality be set in place before having the art assets be put in place.
